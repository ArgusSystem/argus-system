# Beta demo

## Before

1. Run Alpha 'Before meeting' steps
2. Run Beta setup
3. Start Argus

## Demo

1. Run clustering
2. Tag Unknown photos from clusters (Edu, Gabo, Trespasser)
3. Update model
4. Train model
5. Clean beta script
6. Start Argus
7. Run streams-1 (96 unknowns with 0.813 and 150 unknowns with 0.901)
8. Clean beta script
9. Start Argus
10. Run streams-2 (124 unknowns with 0.901 and 219 unknowns with 0.971)

If we train the model with streams-1 before streams-2

- 60 unknowns and 5 FP with 0.901
- 127 unknowns with 0.980
